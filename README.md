# BioMouseTracker

This is the offical GitHub repository, for CSUSB's Biology Department Mouse Tracker Project, for winter & spring 2020 and possibly summer and fall 2020. 

The following project was commissioned by Dr. Angela Horner at CSUSB to Dr. Fadi Muheidat. Students currently assigned to this research project are Juan Inzunza and Heidy Ramirez. 

Here all code, circuit, and any other relevant information will be stored, uploaded, and updated as needed. 

Any future students enlisted to this research project can text or email, either of the previous 2 students for questions or comments regarding the project. (Emails and Phone #'s of Juan and Heidy can be obtained from Dr. Fadi Muheidat)


CURRENT STATE OF PROJECT: 

As of right now the project utilizes a 16x1 multiplexer on the Raspberry Pi. The results of are then logged and tallied on a text file, with it's own unique name containing the data and time of the experiment run. PLEASE NOTE IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE Mousetracker.py FILE ON TOP IN THE COMMENTS SECTION BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM. 

FUTURE SCOPE OF PROJECT: 

Eventually the readings taken from the cages is to be sent to an database/server to be stored online and then used by Dr. Angela Horner in either a mobile app or website where she can then use the data at her discretion.
